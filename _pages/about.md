I am a postdoctral research assosicate in the Department of Physics and the McDonnell Center for the Space Sciences at the Washington University in St. Louis. I work with Dr. Tansu Daylan. My research interests include planetary interiors, exoplanet atmospheres, spectroscopy, biosignatures, habitability, and photochemistry. I primarily work on theory and modeling, but I am also involved in some transmission spectra observations.

Before joining WashU, I obtained my PhD in planetary sciences from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, under the supervision of Dr. Sara Seager. My thesis work focused on reducing the compositional and structural degeneracies of planetary interiors. I got my bachelor's degree from Cornell University with a major in astronomy. At Cornell, I worked under the mentorship of Dr. Lisa Kaltenegger on simulation of high-resolution spectra using radiative transfer code.
