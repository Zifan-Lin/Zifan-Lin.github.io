title: "Rocky Exoplanet Interiors: The Origin of High-Density Planets"
excerpt: "Among all rocky exoplanets known to date, there is a population of super-Mercuries with unexpectedly high densities. If their high densities are due to large iron cores - just like our own Mercury - their formation history must diverge from that of Earth-like planets. Preferential accretion of iron or mantle-stripping giant impacts could occur in the early history of these planets to increase their core mass fractions (CMFs). In [Lin, Cambioni & Seager (2026)](/publication/2025-01-01-most-high), I investigate another possibility: these planets are dense not because of high CMFs, but because they are remnant cores of giant planets that remain in a fossil-compressed state. Using planetary interior and thermal models, I found that high-density planets are unlikely to be naked cores of giant planets, because they are largely molten and will expand as the envelope is stripped away by photoevaporation, and hence cannot remain in a fossil-compressed state. <br/><img src='/images/high_density_flowchart_v2.png' width='800'>"

Some exoplanets have much higher densities than expected from stellar abundances of planet-forming elements. There are two theories-metal-rich formation hypothesis and naked core hypothesis-that explain how formation and evolution can alter the compositions and structures of rocky planets to diverge from their primordial building blocks. Here we revisit the naked core hypothesis, which states that high-density planets are remnant cores of giant planets that remain in a fossil-compressed state, even after envelope loss. Using a planetary interior model and assuming energy-limited atmospheric escape, we show that a large fraction, if not all, of the iron-silicate core of a giant planet is molten during the planet's early evolution. Upon envelope loss, the molten part of the planets can rapidly rebound owing to low viscosity, resulting in a decrease in radius by at most 0.06%, if they had hydrogen/helium envelopes, or by at most 7%, if they had H2O envelopes, compared to self-compressed counterparts with the same core mass fraction. Based on our findings, we reject the hypothesis that all high-density exoplanets are naked cores with Kolmogorov-Smirnov p-value $$\ll 0.05$$ for both envelope compositions. We find that some high-density exoplanets can still possibly be naked cores, but the probabilities are lower than $$\sim$$1/2 and $$\sim$$1/3 for the ice giant and gas giant scenario, respectively, in 95% of the cases. We conclude that most high-density exoplanets are unlikely to be remnant giant planet cores.
