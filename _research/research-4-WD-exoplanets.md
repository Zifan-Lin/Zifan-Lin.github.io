title: "Atmospheres of White Dwarf Exoplanets"
excerpt: "Hypothetical Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting white dwarfs (WDs) are ideal targets for atmospheric characterzation. This is because WDs - the highly compressed remnants of stellar evolution - are much smaller than main sequence stars, thereby enhancing the planet-to-star contrast ratio. In [Lin et al. (2022)](/publication/2022-01-01-h2-dominated), I simulated the atmospheric chemistry and transmission spectra of H<sub>2</sub>-, CO<sub>2</sub>-, and N<sub>2</sub>-dominated atmospheres on Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting cool (less than or equal to 6000 K) WDs. I studied the atmospheric loss of Earth-sized planets throughout the post-main-sequence evolution and concluded that any first-generation H<sub>2</sub>-dominated atmosphere cannot survive. Thus, H<sub>2</sub>-dominated atmosphere is a signature of second-generation planets accreting water-rich materials from WD debris disks and reviving a reduced H<sub>2</sub>-rich atmosphere. <br/><img src='/images/WD_planet_H2_atm.png' width='800' style='margin-top: 1em;'>"

Following the discovery of the first exoplanet candidate transiting a white dwarf (WD), a "white dwarf opportunity" for characterizing the atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets around WDs is emerging. Large planet-tostar size ratios and hence large transit depths make transiting WD exoplanets favorable targets for transmission spectroscopy; conclusive detection of spectral features on an Earth-like planet transiting a close-by WD can be achieved within a medium James Webb Space Telescope program. Despite the apparently promising opportunity, however, the post-main sequence evolutionary history of a first-generation WD exoplanet has never been incorporated in atmospheric modeling. Furthermore, second-generation planets formed in WD debris disks have never been studied from a photochemical perspective. We demonstrate that transmission spectroscopy can identify a second-generation rocky WD exoplanet with a thick ($$\sim1$$ bar) H<sub>2</sub>-dominated atmosphere. In addition, we can infer outgassing activities of a WD exoplanet based on its transmission spectra and test photochemical runaway by studying CH<sub>4</sub> buildup.
