We report the validation of multiple planets transiting the nearby ($$d = 12.8$$ pc) K5V dwarf HD 101581 (GJ 435, TOI-6276, TIC 397362481). This system consists of at least two Earth-size planets whose orbits are near a mutual 4:3 mean-motion resonance, HD 101581 b ($$P = 4.47$$ days) and HD 101581c ($$P = 6.21$$ days). Both planets were discovered in Sectors 63 and 64 TESS observations and statistically validated with supporting ground-based follow-up. We also identify a signal that probably originates from a third transiting planet, TOI-6276.03 ($$P = 7.87$$ days). These planets are remarkably uniform in size and their orbits are evenly spaced, representing a prime example of the "peas-in-a-pod" architecture seen in other compact multiplanet systems. At $$V = 7.77$$, HD 101581 is the brightest star known to host multiple transiting planets smaller than $$1.5\,R_\oplus$$. HD 101581 is a promising system for atmospheric characterization and comparative planetology of small planets.
